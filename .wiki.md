# Project Summary
The AI Pitching Coach is a web application designed to help users enhance their pitch presentations through AI-powered feedback. The platform allows users to upload pitch decks, record their pitches, and receive instant transcriptions and analyses. The product aims to provide a clean, modern, and user-friendly interface, ensuring a seamless experience for users seeking to improve their presentation skills.

# Project Module Description
The application consists of several key functional modules:
- **Landing Page**: Introduces the product and provides a call-to-action to start using the studio.
- **Studio Page**: Main area for uploading pitch decks and recording pitches, featuring:
  - **Pitch Deck Upload**: Users can drag and drop or select files for upload.
  - **Recording Module**: Allows users to record audio pitches with a timer and controls.
  - **Transcription Display**: Shows the results of the audio transcription in various formats (transcript, segments, words).
